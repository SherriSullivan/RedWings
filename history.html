They moved to the new arena in 1927, the first year with Jack Adams on the bench. He would be the face of the club for the next 36 years.</p>                    <p>They made it to the Stanley Cup Finals just once as the Cougars, in 1929, a losing effort against the Toronto Maple Leafs.</p>                </article>                <article>                    <h3>Detroit Falcons</h3>                    <p>In 1930, the team was renamed the Falcons. They made it to the playoffs in 1932, losing once again to the Toronto Maple Leafs. That year, James E. Norris bought the team, and renamed it the Red Wings.</p>                    <p>He and both of his sons are now in the Hockey Hall of Fame. The Norris Trophy, awarded to the top defenseman in the NHL, is named in his honor.</p>                </article>            </section>            <h2>Victory and Defeat</h2>            <h3>1946 - 1983</h3>            <section class="twoColumn">                <article>                    <h3>Gordie Howe</h3>                    <p>Under Jack Adams, manager for 36 years and the only person to win the Stanley Cup as a player, coach, and manager, the team excelled.</p>                    <p>This era gave us the Production Line of Gordie Howe, Sid Abel, and Ted Lindsey. Gordie Howe, known as Mr. Hockey, led the team to first place in NHL seven consecutive seasons, and brought home the Stanley Cup in 1950, 1952, 1954, and 1955.</p>                </article>                <article>                    <h3>The 'Dead Wings'</h3>                    <p>And then, the 'Dead Wings'. Between 1967 and 1983, Detroit only made the playoffs twice, and only won one series. Coaching woes, lack of defense, and goaltending difficulties marked this era in Red Wings history.</p>                    <p>The beginning of the turn-around was marked by a new owner, Mike Ilich, and a new arena, JLA &mdash; Joe Lewis Arena on the banks of the Detroit River.</p>                </article>            </section>            <h2>Hockey Town</h2>            <h3>1983 - 2012</h3>            <section class="twoColumn">                <article>                    <h3>Stevie Y</h3>                    <p>Stevie Yzerman, the youngest captain in Red Wings history, had the job of bringing the team back into contention. Several seasons of 60+ goal scoring was not enough to ensure playoff success.</p>                    <p>Critics complained that Yzerman was too 'soft' a captain, and would not be able to lead the team to a Stanley Cup. The team responded.</p>                    <p>They sought and obtained players to support Stevie's skill, and Stevie changed his game to become a great 2-way player. The Red Wings were on the brink of success.</p>                    <p>Yzerman earned the title of 'The Captain'. He played in 10 All-Star games, won 3 Stanley Cups, tons of awards (no, I didn't weigh them), was the longest serving captain in NHL history, and had his number retired by a team that could not praise him enough.</p>                </article>                <article>                    <h3>The World</h3>                    <p>The Russian Five: Fetisov, Kozlov, Konstantinov, Federov, and Larionov, helped the team win the Stanley Cup in 1997 after a 42 year drought. The Wings would repeat as Stanley Cup Champions in '98 on the slogan "Believe", dedicating the season to Konstantinov who had been injured in a limousine accident while celebrating the first Stanley Cup.</p>                    <p>After the Russians came the Swedes: Lidstrom, Holmstrom, Ericcson, Franzen, Kronwall, Lilja, Samuelsson, and Zetterberg. And Datsyuk. And garnered two more Stanley Cups.</p>                    <figure>                        <img src="images/ZandDats.png" alt="Zetterberg and Datsyuk take over the world" />                        <figcaption>Zetterberg and Datsyuk take over the world.</figcaption>                    </figure>                </article>            </section>        </main>        <footer>            <h2 id="RW_mainsite">                <a href="https://www.nhl.com/redwings" target="_blank">Official NHL<br/>Red Wings site</a>            </h2>            <div id="contact_info">                <h3>Sherri Sullivan</h3>                <p><a href="mailto:sherril.sulli@gmail.com?Subject=history">sherril.sulli@gmail.com</a></p>                <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sherrisullivan/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></p>                <p>&copy; 2019</p>            </div>        </footer>    </div>  <!-- end wrapper div --></body></html>
